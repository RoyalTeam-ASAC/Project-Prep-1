What is the vision of this product?
This product will be able to connect developers and job employers on one platform and be able to allow the developer to apply to jobs that are generated by an API. The developer
will also be able to create his own profile and add it on the website and be able to show off his profile in order to get recognized by employers.

What pain point does this project solve?
This project eases the process for an upcoming or current developer in order to add his profile online and get exposed by employers. This project will also allow the developer to
 search for jobs and apply to them and hopefully get hired by them.

Why should we care about your product?
You should care about our product because this product will hire lots of unemployed developers and match lots of skills with potential employers.



What will your MVP functionality be?
Our MVP will display the layout of the project and the basic functionalities on how Jobs will be displayed and selected.

What are your stretch goals?
Our stretch goals include adding apply button in order to automate the application process instead of letting the user leave to a new website to apply.
Another stretch goal is to include all the jobs that the dev. showed interest in by showing them in his profile as a list.




##  Functional Requirements:

The user, which is a potential developer, will reach the website and see the main page where he can then navigate to read more about the website's features.
Then, the user developer will be asked to signup if he needs to apply for Jobs and get recognized by employers.
The user will then navigate to his profile, fill up his resume and add it to his profile space.
The user will then need to click on "Find a Job" and apply for jobs that he's interested in.


##  Security:
We will be using auth0 security login, where the details of google's login information of the person will be securely encrypted and transmitted, and then the website will get the 
information back without seeing any private information.


##  Usability:
The website is very starter friendly. The reason for that is it is very basic in its design and its functionality. THe website will include step 1, step 2 layout where the 
user will be able to easily signup, add his resume and apply for jobs in three simple clicks.

##  Domain Modeling:

                                   Main Page
                                     |
                 Find a Talent/Job          /      Profile     /   Contact Us    /  Login Page
